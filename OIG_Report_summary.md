- The audit aimed to determine FEMA's effectiveness in managing disaster closeouts according to federal regulations and FEMA requirements. [p.1, para.1, lines 1-3]
- Focused on 79 disaster declarations from 2012 or earlier, still open as of October 2022. [p.2, para.2, lines 1-3]

## 2. Key Findings

### a. Expired Periods of Performance (POP)

- 26 out of 89 grant programs remained open after POP expiration. [p.3, para.1, lines 1-2]
- These programs had nearly $9.4 million in unliquidated funds. [p.4, para.1, lines 1-2]
- Some programs were past their POP by up to 68 months. [p.4, para.1, lines 2-3]

### b. Multiple Extensions

- 33 programs received POP extensions. [p.5, para.1, line 1]
- 8 programs received closeout liquidation period (CLP) extensions. [p.8, para.1, line 1]
- Extended programs represent over $7 billion in unliquidated funds. [p.5, para.1, lines 3-4]
- Some extensions delayed project closures by up to 16 years. [p.5, para.1, lines 9-11]

### c. Inadequate Documentation

- FEMA often approved extensions without sufficiently detailed justification. [p.7, para.2, lines 1-3]
- Extension approval letters contained vague reasons. [p.7, para.2, lines 4-13]

## 3. Causes of Issues

- Insufficient oversight by FEMA Regional officials. [p.5, para.2, lines 1-2]

- Open-ended nature of guidance under the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). [p.8, para.3, lines 1-2]

## 4. Consequences

- Potential increased risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. [p.8, para.3, lines 3-5]
- Billions in unliquidated funds unavailable for current disaster relief. [p.10, para.1, lines 1-5]
- As of July 2023, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) projected a $4.3 billion deficit by end of fiscal year 2023. [p.10, para.1, lines 1-3]

## 5. Recommendations

### a. Direct FEMA Regions to:

- Begin administrative closeout of 26 identified grant programs with expired POPs. [p.10, para.2, lines 2-5]
- Assess and close 42 grant programs representing $7 billion in unliquidated funding. [p.10, para.2, lines 5-7]
- Review all authorized grant programs with expired POPs for potential closeout. [p.10, para.2, lines 7-9]

### b. Consistently apply FEMA Manual 205-0-1 requirements:

## 6. FEMA's Response

- For Recommendation 2, FEMA will send documentation of actions taken by February 28, 2025. [p.11, para.3, lines 1-3]

## 7. OIG's Analysis of FEMA's Response

- Recommendation 1 is open and unresolved, as FEMA's plan doesn't fully address reviewing all authorized grant programs with expired POPs. [p.11, para.4, lines 1-4]
- Recommendation 2 is open and resolved, pending receipt of supporting documentation. [p.11, para.4, lines 5-6]
